                <p>So it's 2:50pm Friday October 6th 2017. How are things going? Well I havent thrown myself out the window yet! So lets take that as a personal victory. We've talked about a lot of stuff. I clearly don't understand any of it, but they keep telling me that's ok. I'm looking forward to next week! So stay tuned! </p>
