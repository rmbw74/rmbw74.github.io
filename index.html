                Why a software developer?
            </header>
            <p>Over the past 40 years, I have always been insterested in what's going on "behind the scenes" in the world of computers. During my 20 year tenure in the Automotive manufacturing industry I recieved my first taste of software development when I was tasked with the creation of a web based reporting system. I soon became bored of asking our in-house development team if certain things were possible, and started slinging google-fu to figure out stuff. Now I want to learn it for real.  </p>
